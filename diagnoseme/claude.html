I understand the issue - your model is showing signs of overfitting with perfect accuracy. Let me help you improve the machine learning implementation.
Here are the key problems and solutions:

The Random Forest model is being allowed to grow too complex, leading to overfitting
The hyperparameter search space could be better constrained
Cross-validation strategy needs improvement
We need better evaluation metrics

Here's the improved code:
Improved Disease Prediction ImplementationClick to open code
Key improvements made:

Added stratification to train_test_split to maintain class distribution
Constrained the Random Forest parameters to prevent overfitting:

Limited maximum depth
Increased minimum samples required for splits and leaves
Reduced parameter search space


Improved model evaluation:

Added cross-validation
Used balanced accuracy scoring for imbalanced classes
Added proper scaling of features


Enhanced the second prediction function:

Added distance weighting for KNN
Configured SVM with class weights
Added cross-validation scoring


Reduced the number of RandomizedSearchCV iterations to prevent overfitting while still finding good parameters

These changes should result in more realistic accuracy scores and better generalization to new data. The models will now be less likely to memorize the training data and should provide more reliable predictions.
Would you like me to explain any of these improvements in more detail or suggest additional enhancements to the implementation?







tongue





and in my tongue image analysis , accuracy is very less. CNN accuracy is less. fix it

I understand the issue with the tongue image analysis CNN model. The current implementation has several limitations that are affecting its accuracy. Let me provide an improved CNN architecture and training approach.

fix it only , dont use keras or pytorch please. fix my basic mathematical implementation only


I understand that you want to improve the basic mathematical implementation of your CNN without using high-level frameworks. Here's an improved version of your neural network implementation with key enhancements:


Improved Neural Network Implementation
Click to open code
Key improvements made to the neural network:

Weight Initialization:
Implemented He initialization for better gradient flow
Added proper zero initialization for biases
Normalization:
Added batch normalization to stabilize training
Implemented proper training and inference modes
Architecture:
Added LeakyReLU activation for better gradient flow
Implemented proper softmax cross-entropy with label smoothing
Added dropout-like effects through batch normalization
Training Process:
Added momentum to the optimizer
Implemented learning rate decay
Added gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
Added proper data shuffling
Separated training and inference modes
To use this improved implementation, you can modify your existing code:

python

Copy
# Initialize with a deeper architecture
net = NeuralNetwork([64 * 64 * 3, 256, 128, 64, num_classes])

# Adjust training parameters
batch_size = 32
epochs = 30  # Increase epochs
initial_lr = 1e-3  # Start with a smaller learning rate
steps_per_epoch = len(x_train) // batch_size

# Train the model
history = net.train(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, epochs, steps_per_epoch, batch_size, initial_lr)
These improvements should help achieve better accuracy on your tongue image classification task while maintaining the mathematical purity of the implementation. The key is that we're now handling the neural network training process more carefully with proper normalization, initialization, and optimization techniques.
